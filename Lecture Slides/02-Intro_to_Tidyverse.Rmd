# R History lesson:
# What is the `tidyverse`?

---
# The tidyverse

The `tidyverse` is a collection of packages that follow a (somewhat) consistent philosophy and structure.

The term `base R` is sometimes used as an alternative, to refer to only R's built-in packages.

A brief history:

--

**2008:** `plyr` and `ggplot` released as part of **Hadley Wickham**'s doctoral dissertation.

--

**2012:** The pipe (`%>%`) is created.  

*(While the pipe itself is not technically tidyverse, the tidyverse is built around its use.)*

--

**2014:** `dplyr` released; Wickham hired as Chief Scientist at **RStudio**

--

**Today:** A paid team of 20-ish developers maintains a huge number of packages.  (https://www.tidyverse.org/)

---
# The tidyverse

* One philosophy of the **tidyverse** is building **pipe-friendly** functions.

* Another philosophy is using **English verbs** as function names instead of symbols or abbreviations.

* Some consider this more accessible/readable

```{r, eval = FALSE}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}

penguins[penguins$species == "Adelie",]
```


---
# The tidyverse

**Pros:**

* Fairly consistent behavior of functions

    + Predictable **input** and **output** types
    + *"opinionated"*
    + More on this later
    
--

* Semi-guaranteed maintenance of packages

(because RStudio pays developers!)

--

* More available and polished documentation and tutorials

--

* Welcoming community

---
# The tidyverse

**Cons:**

* Sometimes less flexible for complex tasks

--

* Generally slower, especially on big data

--

* Updates frequently -> sometimes this makes your old code unrunnable.

--

* Some people object to **RStudio**'s strong influence over an open-source community.

# Should you use the tidyverse???

--

Even the most die-hard tidyverse fanatics use base R and other packages quite frequently.

--

Above all, the best code approach is the one that

- you enjoy the most 

- gets job done

- lets you collaborate with colleagues.

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Lecture Slides", "Images", "ceci_pipe.jpeg"))

# Prerequisite: The Pipe

* Part of the `magrittr` package (installs with the tidyverse)

--

* Idea:  The **data** is the primary object, so it should come first in your code.

--

* Idea:  Code should read **like a sentence**

--

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Lecture Slides", "Images", "diagram_sentence.jpg"))
```


---
# The Pipe

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dr_bodwin %>%
  do_a_dance()
```
--

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dr_bodwin %>%
  put_on("cool hat") %>%
  do_a_dance(type = "macarena")
```

---

# The Pipe

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('penguins %>% summary()', eval = FALSE) %>% 
  flair("%>%") %>% 
  flair_funs(color = "teal")
```

is the same as

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('summary(penguins)', eval = FALSE) %>% 
  flair_funs(color = "teal")
```

---
# The Pipe

What do you think the following will do?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  arrange(body_mass_g)
```

---
# The Pipe

What do you think the following will do?

```{r}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  arrange(body_mass_g)
```


---

# Summarizing

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('
penguins %>%
  summary()
  ') %>% flair("y(")
```

---
# Cleaning 1: missing data

Oh no!  There was one row of the dataset with missing values.

--

There is no magic answer for how to handle missing values; one solution is to simply drop them from the data.

*Consider - why might this sometimes be a bad idea?*

--

```{r}
penguins <- 
  penguins %>%
  drop_na()

penguins %>% summary()
  
```

---
# Cleaning 2: What's in a name?

The column names in the `penguins` dataset are nice for a few reasons:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
names(penguins)
```

* No capital letters

* Underscores to separate words

* Short but descriptive


--

What if they weren't?

---
# Cleaning 2: What's in a name?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
names(iris)
```
--

The `janitor` package!

```{r}
library(janitor)

iris %>%
  clean_names
```



---
# Summarizing specific variables

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('
penguins %>%
  summarize(mean_mass = mean(body_mass_g))
  ') %>% 
  flair("ize(") %>% 
  flair("mean", color = "teal") %>%
  flair("body_mass_g", color = "cornflowerblue")
```

--

* What are the **required** arguments of `summarize`?  

* Are there any optional arguments?

---

# Many variables?  Many summary statistics?
## No problemo

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('
penguins %>%
  summarize(across(c(body_mass_g, flipper_length_mm),
            list(mean, median)))
  ') %>% 
  flair("across") %>%
  flair_rx("(mean)|(median)", color = "teal") %>%
  flair_rx("(body_mass_g)|(flipper_length_mm)", color = "cornflowerblue") %>%
  flair_rx("list", color = "darkred")
```

# Making new variables

Verb: `mutate()`

The dataset gets *mutated* to include a new variable.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('
penguins %>%
  mutate(
    bill_size = bill_length_mm * bill_depth_mm
  ) %>%
  summary()
  ') %>%
  flair("mutate") %>%
  flair("bill_size", color = "teal")
```

---

Cool, let's look at our new variable!

```{r, error = TRUE}
penguins %>%
  summarize(mean_bill = sd(bill_size))
```

--

OH NO!

**What happened here?**

---

# We calculated a new variable, but didn't reassign the data object

---

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('
penguins <- penguins %>%
          mutate(
            bill_size = bill_length_mm * bill_depth_mm
          )
          
penguins %>%
  summarize(mean_bill = sd(bill_size))
') %>% 
  flair("penguins <- ")


```

---
# Ordering

Verb: `arrange()`

We **arrange** the dataset in order of a particular variable.

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  arrange(body_mass_g)
```

---

## Related: `top_n`

```{r}
penguins %>%
  top_n(3, body_mass_g)
```

---

# Quick check in!

Remember,

```{r, eval = FALSE}
penguins %>%
  top_n(3, body_mass_g)
```

is the same as

```{r, eval = FALSE}
top_n(penguins, 3, body_mass_g)
```

or

```{r, eval = FALSE}
top_n(x = penguins, n = 3, wt = body_mass_g)
```

---

# Selecting

Verb: `select()`

We **select** which variables we would like to remain in the dataset.

```{r}
penguins %>%
  select(species, body_mass_g) %>%
  arrange(body_mass_g)
```

---

# Filtering

Verb: `filter()`

We **filter** to the rows (observations) we would like to keep in the dataset.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
penguins_new %>%
  select(species, body_mass_g) %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  arrange(body_mass_g)
```

# Grouping and summarizing

---
# `group_by`

* We have learned how to use the `summarize` functions to get information.

* What if you want to summarize your data within categories?

```{r}
penguins %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(mean(body_mass_g))

```
---
# Warning!

## You should **always** have a `summarize` after a `group_by`!!!

(There are other ways to use it, but wait until you are very familiar with `dplyr` to try that.)
