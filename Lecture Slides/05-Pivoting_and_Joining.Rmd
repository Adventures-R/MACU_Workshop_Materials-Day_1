# Tidy Data

---
## Tidy Data Principles

1. Every **variable** is a **column**.

--

2. Every **observation** (or **sample**) is a **row**.

--

3. Every **value** is in a **cell**

---

---
## Tidy Data

Questions to Ponder:

--

What are the **observational units** in the dataset?

--

* In a database of customer demographic info, perhaps it is the *customers*

--

* In a database of transactions, perhaps it is *unique transaction*, i.e, unique combos of *customer* and *date*

--

What are the **variables** we want to study?

--

* Should we have one *numeric* column called `Customer Balance 2020` and one *numeric* column called `Customer Balance 2021`?

--

* Or should we have one *numeric* column called `Customer Balance` and one *categorical* column called `Date`?

---
## Example

Consider the following dataset containing health information of cereals:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
cereals <- read_csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/ll2c9drmlom1ony/cereals.csv?dl=1") %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, ~na_if(.x, -1))
head(cereals)
```


---

## Example

Consider the research question:  *How do the sugar and protein contents compare across cereal manufacturers?*

--

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cereals %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sugars, y = protein, color = mfr)) +
  geom_point()
```

---


```{r, echo = FALSE}
cereals %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sugars, y = protein, color = mfr)) +
  geom_point()
```

---
## Example


```{r}
avg_by_mfr <- cereals %>%
  group_by(mfr) %>%
  summarize(
    mean_sugars = mean(sugars),
    mean_protein = mean(protein)
  )

avg_by_mfr
```

---


.pull-left[
```{r}
avg_by_mfr %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mfr, y = mean_sugars)) +
  geom_col()
```
]

.pull-left[
```{r}
avg_by_mfr %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mfr, y = mean_protein)) +
  geom_col()
```
]

---
## Example

Why are we stuck?

--

Let's return to the **research question**:  How do the nutrient levels (sugar/protein) vary across manufacturers?

--

This question involves **three variables**:

* `manufacturer` - categorical

* `nutrient level`, how many grams of the nutrient in question are present - quantitative

* `nutrient type`, which nutrient we measured - categorical

--

Our data is not **tidy** with respect to this question!

# Pivoting Longer

---
## Pivoting Longer

Right now, our cereal data is **wide**: each nutrient is its own column

```{r, echo = FALSE}
head(cereals)
```


---
## Pivoting

Our goal is to make it **long**: One column for all values, one column for nutrient type labels.

--

`pivot_longer()` function need to know:

* Which columns are involved in the pivoting

* What you will name the new **values** variable

* What you will name the new **labels** variable

---

## Pivoting

```{r}
cereals_longer <- cereals %>%
  select(name, mfr, protein, sugars) %>%
  pivot_longer(protein:sugars,
               names_to = "Nutrient",
               values_to = "Amount")

cereals_longer
```

---

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cereals_longer %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mfr, y = Amount, fill = Nutrient)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

---

```{r, echo = FALSE}
cereals_longer %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mfr, y = Amount, fill = Nutrient)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

---

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cereals_longer %>%
  group_by(mfr, Nutrient) %>%
  summarize(
    avg_amount = mean(Amount)
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mfr, y = avg_amount, fill = Nutrient)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```

---

```{r, echo = FALSE}
cereals_longer %>%
  group_by(mfr, Nutrient) %>%
  summarize(
    avg_amount = mean(Amount)
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mfr, y = avg_amount, fill = Nutrient)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```

# Pivoting Wider

---
## Example

Let's now return to the `penguins` dataset:

```{r}
head(penguins)
```

---
## Example

Suppose we want to ask the question,

> How much do female and male bill lengths differ, on average, by species?

--

```{r}
avg_bills <- penguins %>%
  group_by(species, sex) %>%
  summarize(
    avg_bill = mean(bill_length_mm)
  ) 

avg_bills

```

---
## Example

```{r, eval = FALSE}
avg_bills %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  mutate(
    ??????? - ?????
  )

```

---
## Example

What went wrong?

--

We wanted to subtract the variable `avg_bill_female` from the variable `avg_bill_male`.

--

But these are not variables!!!

--

Our data is not **tidy** with respect to our research question.

---
## Example

```{r}
avg_bills_wider <- avg_bills %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = sex,
              values_from = avg_bill)

avg_bills_wider
```

---
## Example

```{r}
avg_bills_wider <- avg_bills %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = sex,
              values_from = avg_bill,
              names_prefix = "avg_bill_")

avg_bills_wider
```

---
## Example

```{r}
avg_bills_wider %>%
  mutate(
    bill_diff  = avg_bill_male - avg_bill_female
  ) %>%
  arrange(bill_diff)
```

## Joining Datasets

---



## Left Join (and Right Join)

A **left join** prioritizes the **first** dataset.

--

We use it when we are trying to add information from Dataset B into Dataset A,
without changing the structure of Dataset A.

--

`left_join()` in `dplyr`

--

A **right join** is the same thing, but prioritizing the **second** dataset.

---

---

![](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/project/tidyexplain/images/left-join-extra.gif)

---

## Full Join

A **full join** retains **all information** in **either dataset**.

--

`full_join()` in `dplyr`

--

It is used when you have data from two sources, and you want to combine them into one dataset.

--

Note:  Missing information becomes "NA"!


---

![](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/project/tidyexplain/images/full-join.gif)

---

## Inner Join

An **inner join** retains only information for the observations that appear in **both datasets**.

--

`semi_join()` in `dplyr`

--

Careful!  If your subject isn't in **both** Dataset A and Dataset B, the info will be lost!

--

This is used to create a dataset with *no missing information*

---

![](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/project/tidyexplain/images/semi-join.gif)

---

## Outer Join

An **outer join** retains only information that appears in **one, but not both** of the datasets.

--

`anti_join()` in `dplyr`

--

It is rarely practical as a data creation.

--

Instead, we use it as a shortcut to answer questions about which observations are not in both datasets.
